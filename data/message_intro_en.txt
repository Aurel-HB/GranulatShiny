Extraction of marine sediments in the North Atlantic, including the Baltic and North Seas, has risen sharply, from a few hundred thousand m³ per year in the early 1970s to millions in the 1990s and tens of millions of m³ in recent years (5). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) centralises information on the volumes extracted in the various countries of the North Atlantic arc and transmits this information to OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic). OSPAR brings together 15 governments and the European Union to protect the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. The ICES Working Group on the Effects of Marine Sediment Extraction on the Marine Ecosystem (WGEXT) endeavours to report on the state of scientific knowledge through annual scientific reports (1)(5). Its aim is to provide a synthesis of data relating to marine sediment extraction, the mapping of marine resources and habitats, changes in the legal regime and research projects relevant to the assessment of environmental effects (1)(5). 
In France, the extraction of marine aggregates is governed by the Mining Code and the Environmental Code. The latest forecasts indicate that France has a resource estimated at 170 billion cubic metres of marine aggregates (6); the volume extracted annually is estimated at around 4 million cubic metres (9)(6). According to UNICEM (Union nationale des industries de carrières et matériaux de construction), by 2019, marine aggregate production will account for 2% of national aggregate production (7)(8). The DGALN (Direction générale de l'Aménagement, du Logement et de la Nature), which is part of the French Ministry of the Environment, is responsible for managing marine aggregates on behalf of the French government, and has worked on drawing up reference documents to establish a framework for the sustainable and balanced management of marine aggregate exploration and exploitation. Two main documents have resulted from this work; the Methodological Guide for the preparation of Guidance Documents for the Sustainable Management of Marine Aggregates (DOGGM) (2), intended to help public authorities and stakeholders to set exploitation objectives at facade level within the broader framework of the definition of Strategic Facade Documents (DSF), and the Technical Guide for the preparation of impact studies prior to the exploration and exploitation of marine aggregates (4), which is aimed at marine aggregate operators, as well as government departments and experts, and is intended to clarify the match between the resources allocated to impact studies and the issues identified, and to facilitate the examination of application dossiers and the establishment of appropriate and proportionate exploitation prescriptions. 
The extraction of marine aggregates exerts various pressures on the physical, chemical and biological state of the environment (2)(4). The list of these pressures is detailed in the Guide méthodologique pour l'élaboration DOGGM (2) (p.151). For bentho-demersal and pelagic fish, the main pressures identified from marine aggregate extraction are direct extraction and disturbance of species. These pressures can potentially lead to a reduction in biomass and biodiversity in the area and alter the trophic chain (2). The reference protocol for monitoring fishery resources (3) proposes a methodology for assessing the impacts on fishery communities, from sampling to statistical analysis of the data, in order to meet the objectives of describing the initial state of the environment, the reference state before works and regulatory environmental monitoring. The analyses carried out must be able to characterise the impact of the human activity in question, taking into account the natural variability of the environment. 
GranulatShiny was developed by Ifremer's dedicated teams as part of its Public Policy Support mission (AGREEMENT N°210 276 9907; REF/IFREMER 19/1000085-AV1) with the aim of making the proposed methods easier to use and reporting the associated information.
